...Anyway, I could care less.

I think you mean you couldn't care less. Saying you could care less implies you care at least some amount.

I dunno.

We're these unbelievably complicated brains drifting through a void,  trying in vain to connect with one another by blindly flinging words out into the darkness.

Every choice of phrasing and spelling and tone and timing carries countless signals and contexts and subtexts and more, and every listener interprets those signals in their own way. Language isn't a formal system. Language is glorious chaos.

You can never know for sure what any words will mean to anyone. All you can do is try to get better at guessing how your words affect people, so you can have a chance of finding the ones that will make them feel something like what you want them to feel. Everything else is pointless.

I assume you're giving me tips on how you interpret words because you want me to feel less alone. If so, then thank you. That means a lot. 

But if you're just running my sentences past some mental checklist so you can show off how well you know it.

Then I could care less.

### Formal language

In mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, a formal language consists of words whose letters are taken from an alphabet and are well-formed according to a specific set of rules.

In the final minutes of the discussion, LeCun, perhaps being a little provocative, claimed language is “not that complicated”, nor that crucial to achieving general intelligence (59:54). To support this, he appealed to the fact that orangutans are almost as intelligent as humans, yet they have no language.

In response, Manning leaped to the defense of language (1:01:05). Language, he claimed, is crucial to general intelligence, because language is the conduit by which individual intelligence is shared and transformed into societal intelligence (1:01:29).
